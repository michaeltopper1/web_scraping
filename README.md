# Web-scraping Projects

This repository is a collection of web-scraping projects using RSelenium that I do in my spare time. As of right now, I only have two basic projects up.

## Pokemon
In this folder, I scrape all of the pokemon card pricing data for three separate collections of pokemon cards. This was for my benefit, as I was selling my pokemon cards and wanted a quick way to sort through the prices and make listings.

## Econ UCSB
In this folder, I scrape all of the graduate economics students and their corresponding emails into a data frame. This was inspired by one of my committee members planning to teach this for a class, but could no longer do the exercise when our website changed formatting that required user-clicks.
